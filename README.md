## What is EVA?

EVA is a visual data management system (think MySQL for videos). It supports a declarative language similar to SQL and a wide range of commonly used  computer vision models.

## What does EVA do?

* EVA **enables querying of visual data** in user facing applications by providing a simple SQL-like interface for a wide range of commonly used computer vision models. 

* EVA **improves throughput** by introducing sampling, filtering, and caching techniques.

* EVA **improves accuracy** by introducing state-of-the-art model specialization and selection algorithms.

## Installation

Installation of EVA involves setting a virtual environment using [miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and configuring git hooks.

1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.
```shell
sh script/install/before_install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH" 
sh script/install/install.sh
```

## Development

1. Ensure that all the unit test cases (including the ones you have added) run succesfully.

```shell
   conda activate eva
   python -m pytest --cov-report= --cov=src/ -s --log-level=INFO 
```

2. Ensure that the coding style conventions are followed.

```shell
   python script/formatting/formatter.py
   pycodestyle  --select E src/ test/ --exclude src/filters,src/parser/evaql
``` 

## Architecture 

EVA consists of four core components:

* EVAQL Query Parser
* Query Optimizer
* Query Execution Engine (Filters + Deep Learning Models)
* Distributed Storage Engine
